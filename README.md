# 3D-Squares

3D Squares are types of puzzles consisting of nine squares with half on an image on each side. The objective is to correctly match each half with its corresponding pair. 

There are over 10 billion combinations of possible positions/rotations of pieces.

A brute force algorithm was created to iterate through all of the combinations until a solution was found. 

"3d_puzzle.docx" provides a thorough explanation of the approach.
